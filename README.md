# Implement-Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to provide a clear and concise understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood, and to serve as a learning resource for those interested in diving deeper into the mathematics and programming concepts involved in machine learning.

# Algorithms Implemented
The following machine learning algorithms have been implemented from scratch:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Adaboost
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Naive Bayes
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Autoencoder 
* Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
* Deep Belief Network (DBN)
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

# Getting Started
To use any of these algorithms, simply download the corresponding Python script and run it in your Python environment. Each script includes comments and explanations of the algorithm's implementation, as well as example code for using the algorithm on a sample dataset.
